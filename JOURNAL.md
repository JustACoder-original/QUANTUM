## 10/6/2025 - Picked Led  

### Main

I have **FINALLY** landed on a led I want to use for my project. I want to use a `SFH 4550-EWFW` Infrared emitter. It seems that this led has the least (they call it viewing angle, but you can't actually see the light) angle, a low current and voltage draw, and the right wavelength. (6 degrees, 100ma, 1.5v, 860nm, respectively) so it seemed like a good choice.

### Notes on the part selection

Power:

I wish I could use something more high power for the ns, but I didn't wanted to blow out the raspberry pi pico I'm using for the controller by running an amp through it.

Wavelength: 

I decided to go with a 860nm wavelength, mainly because it was easier. If they offered a led in the 950 range (860nm leds have a faint glow to them), I would've gone with that, but they don't. Hopefully visible light doesn't get in the way...
