## 10/6/2025 - Picked Led  

### Main

I have **FINALLY** landed on a led I want to use for my project. I want to use a `SFH 4550-EWFW` Infrared emitter. It seems that this led has the least (they call it viewing angle, but you can't actually see the light) angle, a low current and voltage draw, and the right wavelength. (6 degrees, 100ma, 1.5v, 860nm, respectively) so it seemed like a good choice.

### Notes on the part selection

Power:

I wish I could use something more high power for the ns, but I didn't wanted to blow out the raspberry pi pico I'm using for the controller by running an amp through it.

Wavelength: 

I decided to go with a 860nm wavelength, mainly because it was easier. If they offered a led in the 950 range (860nm leds have a faint glow to them), I would've gone with that, but they don't. Hopefully visible light doesn't get in the way...

>I finally found it!!   

## 10/8/2025 - Found a display.  

## Log

Yesterday, I found a display to use! After a lot of research and decision, and with a great tip from slack user `Rudy` I went to aliexpress. This was my first time shopping for something there, and **BOY** was it a experience. After many cheap and good displays flirting the 3pc max at me, I was able to find a kit from the YouKeyi store that had 4. I went ahead and bought it because it was only 99 cents and it looked like it was gonna price hike. (4.35 dolla saved for hq lol)

## Specs

Size: 1.8 inch diagonally.
Resolution: To not buy from aliexpress again
Screen: In front of your eyes
Pins: 8
Pixels: 128x168=20480
Controller: ST7735S

## Final notes:

Please bear with me as I figure out markdown, It will be different almost every time, as I develop a style I like.
